# guess_the_number
I decided to spend the 365 days learning python (December 21, 2020 to December 20, 2021. This is a game project I created on day 12. It is called the "Guess the number game". The computer selects a number from 1 to 100 at random. The user has a number of attemps to guess the number depending on the level of the game they selected. Enjoy!
